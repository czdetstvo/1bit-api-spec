# Documentation Guidelines for Junie

This guide explains how to add new pages to the documentation, specifically focusing on the `docs/api-docs/http-services` and `docs/api-docs/web-services` directories.

## General Structure

Our documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. The documentation is organized as follows:

- `docs/` - Main documentation directory
  - `api-docs/` - API documentation
    - `http-services/` - HTTP services documentation
    - `web-services/` - Web services documentation
    - `additional-services/` - Additional services documentation
    - `ftp/` - FTP services documentation

## Adding New Pages

### Adding a New HTTP Service Page

To add a new page to the `docs/api-docs/http-services` directory:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `docs/api-docs/http-services` directory with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-service.md`).
2. Add the following frontmatter at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: X
---
```

Replace `X` with the position where you want this page to appear in the sidebar (1 being the top).

3. Follow the structure of the exemplary file `schedule.md`:
   - Start with a clear title and brief description
   - Include URL pattern and HTTP method
   - Add an info box with related services if applicable
   - Include a parameters section with a table
   - Add detailed parameter descriptions
   - Include examples with request and response samples

4. **Important**: After creating the file, you must update the `sidebars.ts` file to include your new page (see the "Updating sidebars.ts" section below).

#### Example Structure

For a detailed example of HTTP service documentation structure, please refer to the [HTTP Service Example](./.junie/http-service-example.md) file.

### Adding a New Web Service Page

To add a new page to the `docs/api-docs/web-services` directory:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `docs/api-docs/web-services` directory with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-web-service.md`).
2. Add the following frontmatter at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: X
---
```

Replace `X` with the position where you want this page to appear in the sidebar (1 being the top).

3. Follow the structure of the exemplary files `get-enlargement-schedule.md` and `get-schedule20.md`:
   - Start with a clear title and brief description in Russian
   - Include a text block with the method signature and parameters
   - Add parameter descriptions (use tables for complex parameters as in get-schedule20.md)
   - Include a "Возможные ошибки" (Possible Errors) section
   - Add comprehensive XML examples for both request and response

4. For a detailed example of Web service documentation structure, please refer to the [Web Service Example](./.junie/web-service-example.md) file.

5. **Note**: For web services, you do NOT need to update the `sidebars.ts` file as these pages are automatically included using the `autogenerated` feature.

## Updating sidebars.ts

When adding a new page to the `docs/api-docs/http-services` directory, you must update the `sidebars.ts` file to include your new page in the navigation.

1. Open the `sidebars.ts` file in the project root.
2. Find the `HTTP Сервисы` category section:

```typescript
{
  type: 'category',
  label: 'HTTP Сервисы',
  link: {type: 'doc', id: 'api-docs/http-services/index'},
  items: [
    "api-docs/http-services/schedule",
    "api-docs/http-services/appointment-create",
    // other services...
  ]
}
```

3. Add your new service to the `items` array:

```typescript
items: [
  "api-docs/http-services/schedule",
  "api-docs/http-services/appointment-create",
  // other services...
  "api-docs/http-services/your-new-service", // Add your new service here
]
```

4. Save the file.

## Important Notes

- Always use proper Markdown formatting for better readability.
- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting for examples (`json`, `xml`, etc.).
- Include comprehensive examples with both request and response samples.
- Ensure all parameters are well documented with clear descriptions.
- Use info boxes (:::info[Title]...::: syntax) to highlight important information.
- When linking to other pages, use relative paths (e.g., `../web-services/related-service.md`).

## Testing Your Changes

After adding a new page and updating the sidebars (if necessary), you can test your changes by running the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start a local development server where you can preview your changes.
